            <hr >
            <p>
                I am a skilled web developer with a strong focus on designing, developing, 
                and optimizing WordPress websites that are tailored to client needs. 
                By leveraging advanced SEO techniques, I ensure websites perform at their best, 
                both in terms of user experience and search engine rankings. 
                I also utilize Python to create scalable solutions and automate repetitive tasks, 
                while my experience with PhpMyAdmin allows me to effectively manage databases. Additionally,
                I handle financial record management using Xero, ensuring accuracy and compliance in every project.
                <br>
                <br>
                With a proven ability to manage time effectively and prioritize tasks, 
                I am able to consistently meet deadlines without compromising quality. 
                My attention to detail ensures that all work is thoroughly reviewed and refined for precision.
                I also take on leadership roles, guiding and mentoring team members to achieve project success through collaboration and motivation. 
                My broad range of computer skills allows me to effectively navigate various software tools to optimize workflows and deliver high-quality results.
